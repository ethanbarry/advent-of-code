# Welcome to the 8th Annual Advent of Code!

This is my attempt at working through AoC for the first time. I do NOT expect
to be able to complete it all, or even get part-way through it. I want to use
the experience to improve my Rust skills, especially with functional idioms,
so I'm not competing for a place on a leaderboard. I also have a life, so I
need to use my time elsewhere. However, I think this will be fun, and I'll
try to complete as much as possible.

### About this...

- I'm completing it in Rust.
- My objective is to make it as "functional" as possible, using `map()` and `collect()`, &c.
- Most of all, I want to have fun with friends!
